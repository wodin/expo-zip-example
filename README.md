# expo-zip-test

This is a proof of concept for using `react-native-zip-archive` in an Expo app.

Clone the repository and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then follow
the Expo [Development Clients](https://docs.expo.io/clients/introduction/)
documentation to build a dev client. Install the dev client on a device, run
the dev server and scan the QR code to open the app on the device.
